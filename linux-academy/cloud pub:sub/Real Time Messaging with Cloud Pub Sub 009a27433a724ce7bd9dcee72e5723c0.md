1. Publisher application creates a topic in the Cloud Pub/Sub service and send messages to that topic. A message contains a payload and optional attributes that describe the payload content
2. Messages are stored in a message storage until they are delivered and acknowledged by subscribers
3. Pub/Sub forwards messages from a topic to all subscribers individually. Messages can be either pushed by Pub/Sub to subscribers or pullded by subscribers from Pub/Sub 
4. A subscriber receives pending messages from its subscription and acknowledges each one to the Pub/Sub service
5. After message is acknowledged by the subscriber then it is removed from the subscriptionâ€™s queue of messages

1. Under provisioned mean that it simply doesnt have the compute power necessary to keep up - so for example when working with Cloud Dataflow, you
