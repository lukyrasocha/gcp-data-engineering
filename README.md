Update:
I passed the exam in December 2022. Here are the steps I recommend:

1. Read through all the blogs mentioned above to get an overall feeling of what kind of topics are in the exam and what experiences people had with the exam

2. Go through cloud guru courses - there are two about GCP Data Engineering, I recommend going through both of them, especially the Linux Academy one was extremely relevant.

3. Reading google docs in depth was not really necessary, but refer to them anytime you are not sure about some concept mentioned in the courses / practice exams. Reading through BigQuery and other big topics is however a good idea. 

4. Do a LOT of practice exams to know the format of the questions that will be asked
